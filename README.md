# Webcam_Security
The provided code demonstrates a
camera security application with a graphical user
interface (GUI) built using OpenCV and Tkinter
libraries. The app allows users to enable or disable
camera security by entering a password. When
enabled, the app captures video frames from the
webcam, resizes them, and displays the live feed
in the GUI. The code can be further enhanced with
features like motion detection, facial recognition,
cloud storage, mobile app integration, and
advanced encryption to enhance security and user
experience.
